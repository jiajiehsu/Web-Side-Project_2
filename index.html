         <h1>UNITIZED-TYPE</h1>
         <p>In this type of curtain wall system, the parts are already assembled in the factory. The components are installed and brought as a single unit from the factory to the site. This negates the need for individual installation. The size of the unitized curtain walls is directly proportional to the floor to floor height of the structure. Popular in high-rise buildings, they don’t need external supports such as cranes or scaffolding. Only mini cranes or temporary hoist are needed. This system offers the benefits of quick construction and good quality as the components are manufactured in a factory setting. However, this type of curtain wall system tends to increase the shipping charges due to need for larger and better protection during transportation to the site.</p>

        <h1>STICK-TYPE</h1>
        <p>In this type of curtain wall system, the components are assembled piece by piece on the structure of the building. This system is mainly used for low-rise buildings or in small regions. This is due to the fact that for reaching higher elevations it is important to have exterior access. This system promises flexibility as it gives space for onsite adjustments. Though it has the advantage of low shipping costs, the labor and time consumption should not be underestimated as tend to run quite high.</p>

          <h1>THESIS</h1>
          <p>In stick construction, the curtain wall frame is constructed mainly on site with mullions and
            transoms supporting glass, spandrel panels, metal panels and brise-soleils, connected piece
            by piece. Each mullion is usually supported by the floor or perimeter beams.</p>

          <p>In unitised construction, on the other hand, the curtain wall is composed of large
            units that are assembled in the factory, shipped to the site and erected on the building.
            Aluminium profiles are used to form the frame, which is normally one-storey high. Opening
            vents, glazing and infill panels are built into units before being transported to site.
            As with stick construction, each unit is usually supported by the floor or perimeter beams.</p>

          <h3>STICK CURTAIN WALLING</h3>
          <p>Stick curtain walling systems are versatile and allow for the integration of other systems, such as sliding doors and windows. They tend to be less specialised and can be built by all types of fabricators as they are not dependent on having a large factory.</p>
          <p>However, stick systems do require multiple steps to erect and seal the wall, which means more time is spent on site – an approximate rule of thumb would be that 70% of the work is carried out on site, with 30% in the factory. This incurs further costs, such as labourers’ time.</p>
          <h3>UNITISED CURTAIN WALLING</h3>
          <p>For unitised curtain walling, about 30% of the work is done on site, while 70% is carried out in the factory. The complete assembly of the units in the factory brings a number of benefits.</p>
          <h4>These include:</h4>
          <li>Improved quality control</li>
          <li>Concurrent manufacture and site preparation - units can be assembled while the structural frame is being built. The facade can also be
              completed a floor at a time, allowing parallel internal work</li>
          <li>Quicker installation, requiring less manpower on site</li>
          <li>No need for scaffolding</li>
          <li>Can be installed from the interior of the building. This is ideal for high towers or building sites where there is a tight footprint</li>
          <li>Less space is needed on site for layout – another advantage</li>
          <p>Another advantage of unitised systems is that, unlike stick systems, they do not transfer impact noises from floor to floor or horizontally from room to room. This is because the unitised panels are separated by linking gaskets. The different materials (ie, gasket to aluminium), become acoustically excited to different levels, thus creating full separation at the junctions between units.</p>
          <p>The increased use of factory assembly introduces other important considerations.</p>
          <li>The workshop has to be adequately equipped to handle finished elements</li>
          <li>Additional transport is required to get finished elements to site</li>
          <li>Additional equipment is required on site for installation of the modules.</li>

         <h1>Unitized vs Stick. When and why?</h1>

         <p>Curtain wall specialists, be them consultants, system designers or facade contractors, use to have a clear opinion on when to go for a unitized vs. a stick curtain wall system in a given facade project. This is not the case with architects, much less with developers and other specialists: for them choosing one system over the other seems like a dark subject.</p>
         <p>Is it that difficult? Not really. Based on my experience, the main drivers for selecting unitized vs. stick are these five:</p>
         <img src="image_4.png" style="width:60%; display:block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" alt="">
         <p style="color:#ccc;">Left: stick system with exploded transom ---- Right: exploded unitized system</p>
         <h4>The facade total size.</h4><li>The larger, the more convenient to go for unitized; as it will mean less total cost and higher speed of installation. For a standard curtain wall in a typical all-glazed building, the borderline sits somewhere between 3,000 and 5,000 m2. Less than 3,000 m2, go for stick: there is too little space to develop a unitized system with an economy of scale. More than 5,000 m2, go for unitized: a stick system that large would be slow to erect, less reliable and too costly. A facade size in between: read more below.</li>
         <h4>The degree of repetition.</h4><li>If the height of floors is constant and the distance between mullions is repetitive, breaking the facade into units of a similar size makes sense. These units would be prefabricated at the factory, loaded onto a truck, brought to the site and installed complete with glass, spandrel elements, and gaskets, much quicker than proceeding one stick at a time. The higher the repetition, the better for a unitized facade.</li>
         <h4>The shape and dimensions.</h4><li>A tall building (above 6 floors) facilitates going for unitized. The higher the building, the better for unitized curtain wall as installation time will be less. On the other hand, a low and extended building with an easy to access facade from outside would facilitate going for a stick curtain wall. Large glass dimensions in height and width also push for unitized: the glass units will come protected and will be easier to install using mini-cranes and suction cups.</li>
         <h4>The planarity.</h4><li>Flat, vertical walls are easy to assemble on site with a standard stick system. As they become complicated adding slopes and 3D shapes, the preference goes for prefabrication, factory assembly, factory sealing, and interlocking joints on site allowing for some adjustment. That's a unit system. This is equally valid for penetrations: the more brackets are required for external sunshades and the like, the better it is to fix them at the factory as part of a prefab unit.</li>
         <h4>The allowance for structural movements.</h4><li>If the reasons above were still not enough for a decision, consider the expected structural movement post-installation. Is the building located in a seismic area, and dynamic testing is required? Unit systems will perform better in this case. Is the structure flexible, with shear or floor-to-floor movements to be expected? A unit system will absorb those differential movements better than a stick system.</li>

         <p>In short: the number of reasons to go for a unitized facade is increasing as our projects tend to be larger, taller, more complex in geometry, and are installed in seismic areas. Adding to it that the quality is better and installation time overcomes erection costs, we will see more and more unitized facades in all parts of the world. A note for the Schücos, Wiconas, and Reynaers: learn from the large facade contractors and bring up efficient unitized systems before it's too late!<p>
